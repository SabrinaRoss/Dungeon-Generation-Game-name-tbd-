<p align='center'> Development of a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler project using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The goal is to create a 2D grid-based game featuring procedurally generated dungeons. The project would cover essential C++ concepts like object-oriented programming, entities are represented as objects interacting within the game world. It would also require implementation of random dungeon generation algorithms (e.g., random walk or cellular automata) to create unique, maze-like environments for each playthrough. SFML would be used to render tile-based graphics, handle player movement and input, and manage game loops for real-time gameplay. </p>
